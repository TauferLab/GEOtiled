**Terrain parameters** such as slope, aspect, and hillshading are essential in various applications, including agriculture, forestry, and hydrology. However, generating high-resolution terrain parameters is computationally intensive, making it challenging to provide these value-added products to communities in need. We present a scalable workflow called **GEOtiled** that leverages data partitioning to accelerate the computation of terrain parameters from digital elevation models, while preserving accuracy.
